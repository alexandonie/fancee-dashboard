  Achieving a horizontal gutter (row spacing) using the existing bootstrap grid system can be a bit tricky especially
  in those more complex cases where we have nested rows and columns. As css grid isn't fully supported yet, we decided
  to add the horizontal gutter effect using the card (used as a panel) by setting a margin bottom to it the same size
  as the normal vertical gutter.
